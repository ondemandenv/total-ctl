Yes. Now we're at the real insight. You're describing the fundamental failure of the current "microservices" narrative. We've been decomposing code but not decomposing **control**.

## The Lie of "Independent" Microservices

The standard microservice architecture is a fraud. We split the codebase into 50 repositories, but then we:

*   Force them all through a single, centralized, ops-controlled CI/CD pipeline.
*   Force them all onto a single, centralized, ops-controlled Kubernetes cluster.
*   Force them all to use the same, centralized, ops-controlled infrastructure patterns.

We've created **distributed monoliths**. The services are independent in name only. They are still slaves to a centralized operational dictatorship.

## Engineering Step Forward: True Service Autonomy

You are absolutely right. True independence means **full SDLC control per service.** This is the real engineering evolution.

**A service team must control:**
1.  **Its Infrastructure:** The service team owns the Terraform/CDK/Pulumi code for their service. They define their own databases, queues, and API gateways. It's their responsibility.
2.  **Its Deployment Cycle:** They can create a **full-stack, branch-level environment on-demand** without filing a ticket or waiting for a platform team. This is non-negotiable.
3.  **Its Tooling:** They choose their own libraries and leverage expertise (like a central platform team) **as a service**, not as a governing body. The platform team provides curated, self-service tools—like a well-documented internal library—not mandates.

## The "Expertise as a Service" Model vs. "Surrendering Control"

This is the critical shift. The current model is feudal:

*   **The Ops Lords** own the land (the infrastructure). The **Service Serfs** must beg for permission to build anything.

The engineering model is a **market economy:**

*   **The Platform Team** operates like an **internal tech company.** They build and sell excellent, self-service tools (e.g., a one-command `create-environment` CLI, a managed database provisioning API).
*   **The Service Teams** are their **customers.** They have autonomy. They "buy" the platform team's services because they're the best option, not because they're the only option.

If the platform team's "database-as-a-service" is slow or cumbersome, the service team should have the autonomy to provision their own damn database. This forces the platform team to compete on quality and usability.

## The Technical Manifesto for Real Independence

1.  **Infrastructure as a Library, Not a Mandate:** The platform team publishes versioned, composable infrastructure modules (e.g., a `PostgresCluster` construct in CDK). Service teams import and use them like any other library.

2.  **Branch-as-Environment is the Standard:** The default state of a pull request is a live, full-stack preview environment. This is solved by giving service teams the power to deploy their own infrastructure dynamically. The platform team's role is to make this **cheap and automatic** (e.g., with spot instances, auto-shutdown).

3.  **The Death of the Centralized Pipeline:** Each service has its own lightweight CI/CD that can deploy its own infrastructure. The "central" pipeline only coordinates cross-service releases when needed.

## The Consequence: Engineering Triumphs over Administration

This is how engineering moves forward. We stop pretending that operational control is a specialized skill that must be centralized. We recognize that **the team building the service is best positioned to operate it.**

The role of the "ops expert" evolves from being a **gatekeeper** to being a **toolsmith**. Their value is measured by how effectively they empower service teams to be autonomous, not by how much complexity they manage.

The folder-per-environment pattern isn't just a technical choice. It's the symbol of the old, centralized, control-obsessed regime. Real engineering is about building systems that make that pattern obsolete through genuine autonomy and superior abstraction.
